# Hi! I'm Rhuan Barreto! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer that loves to solve problems using technology. Programming is the tool I use the most for solving them. But my life is/was not only about programming.

## Technologies I work today

My main Technologies as of today (December 2022) are:

- Frontend
  - [Vanilla Javascript](http://vanilla-js.com/) for very simple applications
  - [Typescript](roxy.ns.cloudflare.com
sid.ns.cloudflare.com
) for enterprise (structured) applications
  - React bundled with CRA/Vite
  - Tan Stack Query for server-side state
  - [State Colocation](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster) and [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) when a global state is needed
  - Deployment using Github Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cludflare Pages, or a simple Nginx container. The simpler the better.
  - [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for full frontend development. I'm all-in for component based development and SOLID for frontends
- Backend
  - [Parse Platform](https://parseplatform.org/) - No need for making full CRUD backends for simple data
  - [CosmosDB REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cosmos-db/) - They even abstract the DB for you. The rest (pun intended) is simple.
  - [Koa](https://koajs.com/) for middleware backends if previous options cannot solve the problem
  - [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) for complex problems, like integrating with legacy applications
  - Python for Data Science based workloads - Using [Connexion](https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a spec-first framework

## Technologies I have worked with

- ASP (Not ASP.NET!) - After reading a book in the 2000s, I started with my first server-side scripting language. Not so long I discovered PHP
- PHP - After reading the PHP & MySQL Bible book, I jumped all-in into PHP. Wordpress is still my most used CMS.
- jQuery - Does someone still remember jQuery was a thing in the 90s and 2000s?
- ...
