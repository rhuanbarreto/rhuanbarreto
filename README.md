# Hi! I'm Rhuan Barreto! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer that loves to solve problems using technology. Programming is the tool I use the most for solving them. But my life is/was not only about programming.
I started programming very early, since I was 10 years old 

## Technologies I work today

My main Technologies as of today (December 2022) are:

- Frontend
  - [Vanilla Javascript](http://vanilla-js.com/) for very simple applications
  - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for enterprise (structured) applications
  - [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) bundled with Webpack/Vite
  - [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) for server-side state
  - [State Colocation](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster) and [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) when a global state is needed
  - Deployment using Github Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cludflare Pages, or a simple Nginx container. The simpler the better.
  - [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for full frontend development. I'm all-in for component based development and SOLID for frontends
- Backend
  - [Parse Platform](https://parseplatform.org/) - No need for making full CRUD backends for simple data
  - [CosmosDB REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cosmos-db/) - They even abstract the DB for you. The rest (pun intended) is simple.
  - [Koa](https://koajs.com/) for middleware backends if previous options cannot solve the problem
  - [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) for complex problems, like integrating with legacy applications
  - Python for Data Science-based workloads - Using [Connexion](https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a spec-first framework
  - Deployment using docker containers that can be deployed to any cloud-specific service (Azure, GCP, AWS) or using Kubernetes

## Technologies I have worked with

- ASP (Not ASP.NET!) - After reading a book in the 2000s, I started with my first server-side scripting language. Not so long after, I discovered PHP and fell in love for it
- PHP - After reading the [PHP & MySQL Bible](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/PHP5+and+MySQL+Bible-p-9780764557460) book, I jumped all-in into PHP. Wordpress is still my most used CMS. Made many applications in CodeIgniter and CakePHP. Laravel was not a thing in that time.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Does someone still remember jQuery was a thing in the 2000s?
- AngularJS - A brief journey on AngularJS for making simple applications. This journey also included the usage of Ionic Framework
- C for PIC microcontrollers - Using PIC16F for temperature sensor signal conditioning
- C for Arduino - I always played with automation projects, from steering a sailboat to running ping tests on my local network
- C++ - Low level stuff, always when you need it
- C# - You always need to interface with some legacy code that only runs on Windows, right?
